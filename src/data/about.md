# Intro

Hi! I'm Yiwei, an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley.

# Education History

- I was born in Hubei Province in China and lived there until 14. At 12, I was admitted to Wuhan Foreign Language School, and graduated in 2015.
- In 2016, I received a full scholarship from The Ministry of Education in Singapore to study under the SM1 scholarship program. With the scholarship, I finished year 9 and 10 at Raffles Girls' School and then graduated from Raffles Institution Junior College with perfect grades in all A level H2 subjects (Mathematics, Further mathematics, Physics and Economics).
- Since 2021, I began to pursue my bachelor's degree UC Berkeley, double major in Computer Science and Physics. I currently work as a research intern under UC Berkeley EECS Department, where I help to develop an open-source polyglot coordination language called [Lingua Franca](https://lf-lang.org/).
- Summer 2023 I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at [Pure Storage](https://www.purestorage.com/) working on porting the system software from x86 to ARM CPU.
